UW W3 assignment, day planner using jQuery

## Assignment
Create a simple dayplanner, with preset times available, using HTML/CSS/jQuery. The times are standard business hours, in 1 hour increments. Saving is accomplished by clicking the save button on the right of the row. Past, present, and future hours should be colored differently. A starter HTML template - without the "timeblocks" - and a CSS file were provided. Everything else was built as part of the assignment.

I used the Day.js script for times instead of Moment.js; I've used Moment before, and wanted to try something new. Very straightforward and simple to use.

The assignment didn't mention anything about disabling entry for past times, but I went ahead and added that anyway for practice.
